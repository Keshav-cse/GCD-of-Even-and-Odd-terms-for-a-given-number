This project provides a Python solution to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two values:

sumOdd – the sum of the first n odd numbers.

sumEven – the sum of the first n even numbers.

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer n.
Your task is to compute the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven, where:

sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n+1)

sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + (2n)

Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.

Iterating the numbers from 1 to 2n for odd numbers by using for loop
Iterating the numbers from 1 to 2n+1 for even numbers by using for loop

Finding the max between them and then using for loop, iteration till gcd is found. 

Print Result
